# Discord BOT Project Base
This is a base project to make bots for Discord, this include the system of hosting on heroku

# Why this exist?
Ok, let me explain, I create bots for discord, and every time that I will create a new bot, I don't want install all the npms, config, whatever.
Because this I was created this repo with the base of a bot to discord, easy to use, and I make it public for everyone use else

# How i make my own Commands?
For this you need know how use discord api, and JavaScript, search for tutorials

# What apps i need to program like a professional?
you need a code viewer (I recommend visual studio code) and "nodejs".
to host your bot on heroku you need more two apps, "heroku cli" and "git."

# Ok I have all this, how I turn my bot on?
Use the command "node ." on the terminal, if u don't make shitty the bot will start correctly

questions? dm me on discord, is in my bio
