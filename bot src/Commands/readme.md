If you wish, you can change the name of the folders here ("list_one", "list_two") or create new folders to
organize your bot commands.

to create new commands use the "command_base.js" and put in the folder inside "Commands"
after this, delete "readme.txt" and "command_base.js" of Commands 

to create a new command, u can rename the file "command_base" to the name of your command, and to create other command you
just need copy this file and modify the name and the code

questions? dm me on discord, is in my bio
